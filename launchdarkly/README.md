## LaunchDarkly Configuration

LaunchDarkly is a cloud hosted Feature Management solution that offers a trial version for new users. The C# and Python projects are configured by default to use local feature flag files. The JavaScript project is configured with default files only.

If you prefer to use the LaunchDarkly, the flags can be imported running the following command inside the [launchdarkly-import-flags](./launchdarkly-import-flags) folder. You will have to generate an [API key](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

```shell
docker compose up
```

Update the `.env.Development` files with the SDK KEY or CLIENT ID generated by LaunchDarkly.
